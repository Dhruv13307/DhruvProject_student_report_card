<h1 align="center"> Student Report Card Management System (C)</h1>

---

<h2> Project Description</h2>

The **Student Report Card Management System** is a console-based application developed in the **C programming language** to efficiently manage and organize student academic records. The system enables users to perform all essential record operations including adding, viewing, searching, modifying, and deleting student information through a simple, user-friendly menu interface.

Each student record consists of:

* Student ID
* Student Name
* Marks for five subjects
* Average Percentage
* Final Grade (A / B / C / D / F)

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of programming in C, such as **structures, arrays, user-defined functions, loops, and conditional statements**, while maintaining a modular and organized code structure.

<h2> Key Features</h2>

 Add new student records
 Display all stored records
 Search student by ID
 Update existing information
 Delete a student record
 Automatic average & grade calculation
 Menu-driven system
 Maximum capacity: **200 students**

<h2> Technologies & Concepts Used</h2>

* C Programming Language
* Structures (`struct`)
* Arrays
* Functions
* Conditional Statements
* Loops
* Modular Programming
* GCC Compiler

<h2> Repository Structure</h2>

```
/
│── src/
│     └── main.c
│
│── include/
│     └── student.h
│
│── docs/
│     └── ProjectReport.pdf
│
│── assets/
│     └── (Flowcharts, screenshots – Optional)
│
│── sample_input.txt
│── README.md
```

 **Important:** Folder names are *case-sensitive* (`src`, `include`, `docs`) and must match exactly.

<h2> Program Workflow</h2>

1. The program displays a menu with the following options:

   * Add Student
   * Display Students
   * Search Student
   * Update Student
   * Delete Student
   * Exit

2. The user selects a choice between **1 – 6**

3. The system performs the selected operation

4. The program continues until option **6 (Exit)** is chosen

<h3> Grade Calculation Criteria</h3>

| Average Score | Grade |
| ------------- | ----- |
| ≥ 90          | A     |
| ≥ 80          | B     |
| ≥ 70          | C     |
| ≥ 60          | D     |
| < 60          | F     |

<h2> Future Enhancements</h2>

 Permanent data storage using **file handling**
 Input validation and error checking
 Sorting students by average score
 Login authentication system
 GUI version of the application

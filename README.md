<h1 align="center">📘 Student Report Card Management System (C)</h1>

---

<h2>📌 Project Description</h2>

The **Student Report Card Management System** is a console-based application developed in the **C programming language** to efficiently manage and organize student academic records. The system enables users to perform all essential record operations including adding, viewing, searching, modifying, and deleting student information through a simple, user-friendly menu interface.

Each student record consists of:

* Student ID
* Student Name
* Marks for five subjects
* Average Percentage
* Final Grade (A / B / C / D / F)

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of programming in C, such as **structures, arrays, user-defined functions, loops, and conditional statements**, while maintaining a modular and organized code structure.

<h2>✅ Key Features</h2>

✔ Add new student records
✔ Display all stored records
✔ Search student by ID
✔ Update existing information
✔ Delete a student record
✔ Automatic average & grade calculation
✔ Menu-driven system
✔ Maximum capacity: **200 students**

<h2>▶️ How to Compile & Run the Program</h2>

<h3>Using GCC Compiler</h3>

1️⃣ Navigate to the source folder:

```
cd src
```

2️⃣ Compile the program:

```
gcc main.c -o main
```

3️⃣ Execute the program:

```
./main
```

<h2>⚙️ Program Workflow</h2>

1. The program displays a menu with the following options:

   * Add Student
   * Display Students
   * Search Student
   * Update Student
   * Delete Student
   * Exit

2. The user selects a choice between **1 – 6**

3. The system performs the selected operation

4. The program continues until option **6 (Exit)** is chosen

<h3>🎯 Grade Calculation Criteria</h3>

| Average Score | Grade |
| ------------- | ----- |
| ≥ 90          | A     |
| ≥ 80          | B     |
| ≥ 70          | C     |
| ≥ 60          | D     |
| < 60          | F     |
